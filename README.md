## 1. Introduction
Submitting the complete author information with a document can be a daunting feat, especially when there might be hundreds or even thousands of authors. INSPIRE, the American Physical Society and arXiv.org have created a template for you to submit information about the authors. In that way, the information that is communicated will be precise and univerally understood, and, as the saying goes, we will all be "on the same page". Please use the author.xml file schema that is described below, it will aid you to provide your author.xml for the document that you will submit.
